# Week 4 â€“ Flutter Profile UI

This week, we learned how to build beautiful UIs using Flutter Widgets.  
I created a simple **Profile UI** using the following concepts:

## ðŸ”¹ Widgets & Topics Covered:
- **Scaffold**: background color, AppBar, Drawer, FAB, BottomNavigationBar  
- **AppBar**: leading icon, title with style, action buttons  
- **Text**: custom styling with fontSize, fontWeight, and color  
- **Container**: styling with border radius and background color  
- **Column & Row**: alignment and layout  
- **Buttons**: ElevatedButton, TextButton, IconButton  
- **CircleAvatar**: for profile picture  
- **Responsive UI Layout**

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
All the code for this task is inside `my_profile_ui` folder.
