# Type Inference and Null Safety in Dart

This folder contains practice code that covers two core Dart concepts:

## âœ… Topics Covered

1. **Type Inference vs Explicit Types**
   - Understanding when Dart can automatically infer types.
   - Practicing the difference between:
     ```dart
     var name = 'Rabia';        // inferred as String
     String name = 'Rabia';     // explicit declaration
     ```

2. **Null Safety**
   - Understanding `nullable` (`?`) vs `non-nullable` types
   - Avoiding runtime null errors with proper type usage
   - Example:
     ```dart
     String? username;  // nullable
     String email = 'test@example.com'; // non-nullable
     ```

## ğŸ“Œ Goal

The goal is to understand how Dart handles variable types and null values â€” two essential concepts for writing safe and clean Dart/Flutter code.
